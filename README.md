m_cord is a Mastodon API compatible client with a UI inspired by services like Discord. It has a chat style layout for posts, allowing you to view your home, local, and federated feed - as well as any tags you wish to add - in a chat style fashion. Adding a tag as a channel does NOT subscribe your account to that tag, so you can keep tabs on high volume tags without filling up your home feed.

This is likely best used when paired with a standard web interface or app, as m_cord doesn't have fairly standard functionality like notifications or the ability to subscribe to people from within the app itself. The web app itself is a single static HTML file, all functions being performed within your web browser itself, and I collect no data on anything that you do. If you wish to host it yourself it's as simple as downloading **index.html** and placing it on any server or host.
